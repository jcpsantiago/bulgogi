  Takes a request map with keys :input-data and :features.
  :input-data is map with the actual data needed to calculate features;
  :features is a vector of strings with the names of the functions requested.

  Looks for the features in the namespace and applies them to the input-data
  in parallel. Returns a map of feature-keys and feature-values.
